# worker-playground
Quick and dirty web worker playground to poke around (because I needed one.)

## How
Just punch in some expression and hit *Run* to see the result evaluated in a dedicated web worker.

## Features
* Unapologetic use of `eval()`
* Unapologetic use of not one but two `<hr>`s
* Broken but minimalist HTML
* Overrides `<textarea>` font!
* Shows errors, too!
